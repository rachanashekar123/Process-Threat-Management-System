# Working

This system performs a single-time scan of running Linux processes when executed.

- The user starts the script manually using the terminal.
- The script lists active processes along with CPU usage.
- Each process is checked against predefined detection conditions.
- Suspicious processes are displayed as output.
- The user can choose to terminate a process by entering its PID.

The script completes execution after the selected action, without running continuously in the background.
